## Personal Info
I'm a game developer.

## Unreal Source Explained:

*Unreal Source Explained (USE)* is an Unreal source code analysis, based on profilers.

USE is just one [markdown file](unreal_source_explained/main/main.md).

USE's goals are:
- look inside the Unreal engine source;
- cover all submodules (loop, memory, render, animation, physics, ...)
- overview then detailed;
- quantitative analysis;
- accurate explanation;
- for now, focus on Unreal running on mobile devices (iOS, Android);
- in English;

For more infomation, see USE's [repo](https://github.com/donaldwuid/unreal_source_explained) in github.
